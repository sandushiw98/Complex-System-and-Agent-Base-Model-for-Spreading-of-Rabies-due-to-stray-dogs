# Complex-System-and-Agent-Base-Model-for-Spreading-of-Rabies-due-to-stray-dogs
This  project contains a Complex System and Agent base model  for Spreading of Rabies due to stray dogs.The system includes interactions between stray dogs, pet dogs, pedestrians, pet dog owners, and dog sterilization officers, while introducing the vaccination of pet dogs to control the spread of rabies. The system will also model how these agents interact to affect the population and health of both stray and pet dogs, as well how it will affect the health of humans.


# Urban Dog Dynamics and Rabies Spread Simulation

This repository contains a NetLogo simulation that models the dynamics of stray and pet dogs in an urban environment, focusing on rabies spread, interactions with humans, and population management through sterilization.

## Project Description

The simulation explores various dynamics including:
- **Movement:** Dogs move towards food sources and shelters while avoiding roads.
- **Rabies Transmission:** The model simulates rabies spread between stray dogs, from dogs to humans, and the impact of vaccinations.
- **Sterilization Efforts:** Officers play a crucial role by sterilizing stray dogs to control their population.
- **Health Management:** Health levels of dogs decrease over time, particularly if they are infected with rabies.

## Features

- **Dynamic Environment:** Simulates roads, food sources, and shelters that influence animal behavior.
- **Agent-Based Interactions:** Stray dogs, pet dogs, pedestrians, dog owners, and officers interact within the simulation environment.
- **Health and Lifecycle:** Tracks health deterioration, death, and reproduction among the dog population.
- **Global Statistics:** Monitors rabies cases and the effectiveness of population control strategies.

## Getting Started
